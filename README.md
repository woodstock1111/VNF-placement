# VNF-placement
optimally place three virtual network functions in a Fat-Tree data  center using Linear programming

We plan to solve the problem for two following groups of traffic flows: The first table includes two 
traffic flows, and the second table includes 5 traffic flows. For each flow, the source/destination 
nodes, the required bandwidth and the required vNFs has been defined.
